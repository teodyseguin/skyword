- Authentication:
  - Oauth for authentication, how is this supposed to work?
    - Is the Customers site authenticating to Skyword,
      or is Skyword authenticating to the Customer site.

- IP Filtering is something that is built into Services api, so there is not a need
  to build this out. https://www.drupal.org/project/rest_server_ip_filtering provides this
  functionality.

- Taxonomy/ Content in general:
  How much of the site will be controlled by Skyword, and how much freedom does the site owner
  have in regards to setting what taxonomy / author /etc they want on the site?

  Is there a way we can tell Skyword that a specific taxonomy, author, post, etc is deleted by the
  site owner (maybe to prevent re-importing it)?

  Phase 1 - Basic Functionality, Skyword controls the site it is installed on
     ie, creating content, taxonomies, etc.

  Phase 2 - Advanced Functionality, Skyword obeys mappings created by admin users.
    Allowing the admin user to create and map the taxonomies, content, authors to content or entities.

  Phase 3 - Drupal 8 Basic functionality, and upgrade path from Drupal 7.
